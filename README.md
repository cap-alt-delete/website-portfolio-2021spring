*Website Brief*

**"Loose Leaf"**

This website is a mockup for my friend’s dream business. She wants to open a hybrid bookstore-café, which for the project, I’m calling “Loose Leaf.” The site features a breakdown of what can be found at the business: the bookstore section, the café, and an after-hours rentable space.

2. “INDIE FLOWER" font

(Annotations) For playful side comments to make typing look like edited manuscript - this secondary font was chosen on the grounds of https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-font-for-your-design/ advice to use fonts with high contrast but also with a small amount of common ground (Indie Flower uses the typewriter style "a")

10. For the CSS animation of the subtitle, I tweaked the code from this web-post

(Annotations) From the site: "Some use JavaScript, which may sometimes be preferable (literally adding a character at a time feels more like a real typewriter) and sometimes not be (potential accessibility concerns)." - This made me want to make the CSS work for better accessibility.

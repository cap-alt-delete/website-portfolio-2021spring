2. “INDIE FLOWER" font - USED

(Annotations) For playful side comments to make typing look like edited manuscript - this secondary font was chosen on the grounds of https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-font-for-your-design/ advice to use fonts with high contrast but also with a small amount of common ground (I thought Kingthings Trypewriter and Indie Flower had similar stroke weight, and Indie Flower uses the typewriter style "a")
